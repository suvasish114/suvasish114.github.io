Value Props: Creating a product people will actually buy. Working with value prop is not the only thing towards business. For B2B the agenda is to develop that stated as: For (who), dissatisfied with (whom) due to (needs) (company name) offers (product category) that provides (key benifites). 

### Define the users

If your customer is everybody than definitely you will fail. Find a segment of people whom we going to sell. Look at everything though the eyes of your customer. How to find out that the idea your are selling user identify? simply ask them. 

### Define the problem

> "A problem well stated is a problem half-solved" <br>-charles kettering.

Problems worth solving are usually for you are: unworkable, Unavoidable, Urgent, and Underserved. 

**Unworkable**: If the consequences are costly or painful, so much the better. Who gets fired if this doesn't work? Examples: "20% of children remains uneducated", "something makes people unhappy"

**Unavoidable**: Is the problem so fundamental that you can't avoid it and just have to comply? Example: ccounting, government regulations (taxes, debt), educations, etc.

**Urgent**: If you're not at the top of the list, are you at least in the top three? If not, will you get moved up or down over time. Why? It is relative to other needs. Priority which determines resources allocated or choices consumers have to spend their money. (e.g. cyber security, finding a job, getting vaccinate/ thread for covid). Ask people for their (number 1) priorities. In some cases, how do we convey people that this is the most important thing among 10 other things we spending our resources on. 

**Underserved**: somehing is is not served yet. 

For B2C it's more relies on Needs: i.e. social, security, physical, ecnomic, recognition, responsibility, achivement, growth. As example, Facebook (all social network in general) addresses connection between people. Whatsapp enable cheep mobile calling system. Rent the runway is a subcription fashion service that powers people to rent design styles for work, weekends and events, solving a problem that is: unworkable, unavoidable, urgent, underserved. 

Define the market need: (is it BLAC or white?) Blatant, Latent, Aspoirational, Critical. Is it addressing a "white space" in the market? That enables an open area of opportunity, which you can capture, uniquely well. 

Define tha market need: Does the market needs have DEBT? What Dependencies are involved? What External factors are involved?  What would you face any Backlash? What is the timing?

### The 3D framework

Startup Opportunity? Must need to create a product that is faster, cheaper, and better. There probability something that more than just faster, better and cheaper. Define the solution: Disruptive, Discontinuous and Defensible (A breakthrough that comples people to act). 

**Disruptive**: As examples- a technology like multi-touch, a business model like Airbnb. Was amazon was a disruption when it came out? 

**Discontinuous**: Someting you could not do before this? example AWS. 

**Deefensible**: it form the outset such as: Proprietory IP, government license, favorable location, Favorable efficient scale facility, access to data, etc. Defensibility with scale: network effects, switching costs, cost advantages due to scale, brand loyalty. 

## Evaluation

Ask yourself, what was the situation before your product and after your product. Such as from a state of "acute pain" to "absolute joy". The gain pain ratio is increadability simple and powerful. It is the gain delivered to the customer vs the pain and cost for the customer to adopt.  


## Why are vision mission and culture are important

ventures are worth little to nothing without: vision, mission to attract, retain, and unify all stakeholders. And culture is to select the right people. If you not clear with your vision, your customer will not be able to connect with the product. If we get it right, it should help you in execution to building the business: it should bring focus, alignment, and empowerment.
