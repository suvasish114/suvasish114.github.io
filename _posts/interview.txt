I was motivated to pursue PhD during my masters thesis work on NLP. I applied for regular PhD program at IIT Gandhinagar, though I didn't have any fellowships. I have been shortlisted for the first round. The interview was completely virtual and conducted via zoom meeting. My interview was scheduled on 20 april 2024 at 12:30 PM. There was two panelist in the meeting (i.e. `panelist1` was Dr. [Krishna Prasad Miyapuram](https://cogs.iitgn.ac.in/team/krishna-prasad-miyapuram/) and `panelist2` was Dr. [Shanmuganathan Raman](https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/)). The interview was for 5 to 10 minutes.

## Round 1

`panelist1` starts asking questions, as followes

- Tell me about your educational background and research interests.
- How Transformers works in NLP?
- What is positional embedding? and why we need this?
- In bengali, do we need positional embedding and why so?
- What is LSTM and why we use it?
- What is RNN? and how it works?
- Do you hard about Machine Translation? Big tech gients like google microsoft had already developed machine translation. Why still research going on it?
- What will be your research objective, if you pursue PhD?
- If we want to develop a GPT for bengali, how do we do so?
- Suvasish, thank you for your time. `panelist2` have you any question to ask?
- No I have no questions (`panelist2`)
- We shoudl wrap up this conversation. You can leave.

luckily I got shortlisted for the next round of the interview, and they scheduled my round 2 at 22 April 9:40 AM via google meet.

## Round 2

Because I have told them, my research interest lies in the field of NLP, so I was not sure wheather I need to approach any professor before the round 2. I go through the faculty profile at IITGN and found there is one professor who is working on the same field which I have my research interest on. His name was Dr. [Mayank Singh](https://mayank4490.github.io/). I wrote a mail telling him, I want to work under his supervision, and wheather I should mention his name in the round 2 if I need to mention any supervisiors name. The snapshort of the mail is given below

In the round 2, there was 3 panelist this time. First 2 panelist was as before and there was Dr. [Mayan Singh](https://mayank4490.github.io/) as a 3rd panelist. `panelist3` start asking me questions as below

- Tell me some of the projects you worked on.
- Explain the structure of transformer.
-  How normalization works in transformer. (not able to answer)
- Do you know self attention. How it works?
- How word embedding has done in transformer.
- What kind of word embedding you done in your project.
- What is your role in the project you just mentioned.
- What is your long term goal after PhD?
- I have no more question to ask... (he ask other panelist if they have any more question to ask)
- `panelist2` asked When will be your masters ending?
- `panelist1` asked Just to be clear, you have qualified gate right?

## Conclusion

It was a great experience and hopefully the dot created will be connected somewhere in my future.
