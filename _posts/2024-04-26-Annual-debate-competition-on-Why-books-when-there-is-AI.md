It was 23 April 2024, our university has organized a cultural festival at our campus to spread the awarness of reading books. It was a multicultural fest organized with various events like debate, exextempore, poster making, book marking and many more. It was a whole day event. I was a participant for the debate compition. The debate was on the topic of "Why books when there is AI".

I delivered the speech as follows-

Hello everyone. I’m Suvasish Das from the Department of Computer Science. Today I’ll be talking against the favour of the argument made for today “Why books when there is AI”. 

This speech is divided into two sections. In the first section, we’re going to see how books and AI work.

Though it is difficult to put an exact definition of a book, formally it’s a collection of papers that depicts an individual's particular research work which is written in the form of a physical medium. Writing a book involves meticulous planning, thorough research, and creative exploration to bring a story to life.

If we talk about AI, and particularly LLMs which are being trained with human texts: websites, Wikipedia entries, academic articles, and whole books; Popular LLMs such as ChatGPT have swallowed the entire internet for training. At the core, AI models are built on top of human-generated content. As AI models like chatGPT build on top of the internet, they may lead to ambiguous results. Are we ready to rely on that biased knowledge generated by AI?

In the next section, I’ll be discussing why AI can’t replace Books.

A recent study by MIT and Oxford titled “On the Impossibility of Supersized Machines” shows at least seven distinct arguments and concluded that it is not only implausible that machines will ever exceed human size, but in fact impossible.

Though computers are faster than humans, at the core, AI is a small fraction of the human brain, which has been mathematically represented to act like a human. However, our human cognition is much more complex and difficult to mimic, and yet a lot to be discovered. We as a human being, achieved this magnificent cognition ability after more than 2 million years of evolution, but if we look at the history of AI, it’s there for barely less than 50 years. So, it is far from reality that AI will replace Books written by humans shortly.

To achieve human-level efficiency with context represented in books, to derive formulas, to derive definitions just like Books, AI may need another century to achieve this Artificial Super Intelligence.

In concluding remarks, all the points and facts I have delivered in this speech, indicate to one conclusion that AI is for assisting humans, to work with humans, but not to replace humans. So the points made for today's topic indicate that “Books can never be replaced by AI”.
