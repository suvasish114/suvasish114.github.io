I was motivated to pursue PhD during my masters thesis work on NLP. I applied for regular PhD program at IIT Gandhinagar, though I didn't have any fellowships. I have been shortlisted for the first round. The interview was completely virtual and conducted via zoom meeting. My interview was scheduled on 20 april 2024 at 12:30 PM. There was two panelist in the meeting (i.e. `panelist1` was prof. [Krishna Prasad Miyapuram](https://cogs.iitgn.ac.in/team/krishna-prasad-miyapuram/) and `panelist2` was prof. [Shanmuganathan Raman](https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/)). The interview was for 5 to 10 minutes.

## Results

Some of the questions I was not able to answer. Sepcifically the last one about developing GPT for bengali. This was my first interview experience and I was a bit narvious (which is obvious for the first time). I thought the interview is going to be arranged based on GATE CS lavel questions (which I was prepared well), but it was arranged based on Natural Language Processing. Frankly speacking, I have been introduced with NLP less than 6 months, and I lack a lot of NLP concepts.

As predicted I was not selected. But, it was a great experience and hopefully the dot created will be connected somewhere in my future.
