## About

I'm a computer science grad student, doing my M.Sc from West Bengal State University. I am a highly motivated versatile
person, bringing proficient knowledge of multiple programming languages and frameworks including C/C++, Python,
Tensorflow, Flask, etc. I have a particular research interest in Deep Learning. I like designing & building products
that positively impact the lives of users. I don't associate myself with specific tools and technology. This mindset has
helped me be a quick learner and concentrate more on solving the problem at hand.
