I am a 2nd-year PhD student at [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am being guided by [Prof. Varsha Apte](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~varsha/) and [Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/). My key research interest lies in the field of reasoning of DL models and Multimodal AI, with a particular focus on Intelligent Systems for pedagogy-aware interactions.

I have completed Masters in Computer Science from [West Bengal State University](https://wbsu.ac.in/web/) in the year of 2024, where I have been advised by [Dr. Rajat Pandit](https://wbsu.ac.in/web/faculty/dr-rajat-pandit/) & [Dr. Sudip K Naskar](https://sites.google.com/site/sudipnaskar/). I have completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from [Barrackpore Rastraguru Surendranath College](https://www.brsnc.in/) in the year of 2022, where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Sukalyan Som](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=vhkRGncAAAAJ&hl=en).
