I've completed Masters in Computer Science from [West Bengal State University](https://wbsu.ac.in/web/), where I'm advised by [Dr. Rajat Pandit](https://wbsu.ac.in/web/faculty/dr-rajat-pandit/) & [Dr. Sudip K Naskar](https://sites.google.com/site/sudipnaskar/). My key research interest lies in the field of Deep Learning and NLP. Currently, I'm actively looking for a sponsored project position in Deep Learning.

I completed my Bachelor in Computer Science from [Barrackpore Rastraguru Surendranath College](https://www.brsnc.in/) in the year of `2022`, where I've worked under [Dr. Sukalyan Som](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=vhkRGncAAAAJ&hl=en).
