I'm pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from [West Bengal State University](https://wbsu.ac.in/web/), where I'm advised by [Dr. Rajat Pandit](https://wbsu.ac.in/web/faculty/dr-rajat-pandit/) & [Dr. Sudip K Naskar](https://sites.google.com/site/sudipnaskar/). My key reserch interest lies in the field of Deep Learning and NLP. Currently I'm actively looking for sponsored project position in Deep Learning.

I had completed my Bachelors in Computer Science from [Barrackpore Rastraguru Surendranath College](https://www.brsnc.in/) in the year of `2022`, where I've worked under [Dr. Sukalyan Som](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=vhkRGncAAAAJ&hl=en).
